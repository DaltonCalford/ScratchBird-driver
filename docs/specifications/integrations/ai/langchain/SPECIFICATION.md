# langchain Integration Specification

Status: Draft
Priority: P1
Category: AI & Machine Learning

## 1. Goals

- Define compatibility requirements for langchain.
- Specify driver/protocol features required for integration.

## 2. Integration Path

- Primary driver/protocol used.
- Authentication requirements.
- Metadata coverage.

## 3. Required Features

- TLS required; reject plaintext or sslmode=disable.
- Binary-only parameter binding enforced; reject binary_transfer=false.
- Full SBWP v1.1 message coverage for parse/bind/execute, ready/paging.
- SQLSTATE mapping must be spec-complete and surfaced in errors.
- Metadata helpers must use sys.* contract and return stable schemas.
- All wire types in TYPE_MAPPING_MATRIX.md must encode and decode.
- Streaming/paging must honor fetch_size and row batching.
- Timeouts/cancel semantics must follow DRIVER_CANCELLATION_TIMEOUTS.md.

## 4. Security & Compliance

- TLS 1.3 preferred with server certificate validation.
- Credential handling must avoid logging secrets.
- Connection strings must support secure credential sources.

## 5. Observability

- Expose connection state and last SQLSTATE for debugging.
- Provide lightweight logging hooks (disabled by default).

## 6. Performance Expectations

- Avoid per-row allocations in hot loops.
- Use buffered I/O for network reads and writes.
- Support prepared statement reuse and pooled connections.

## 7. Compatibility Notes

- Validate SQL dialect assumptions with ScratchBird.
- Ensure parameter binding uses SBWP binary-only encoding.

## 8. Testing

- Unit tests for encode/decode of all wire types.
- Integration tests against live ScratchBird server.
- Conformance harness integration where applicable.
- Metadata contract validation tests for sys.* queries.


## 10. System Constraints & Vendor Quirks

- LangChain SQL integrations expect SQLAlchemy-style connection URIs.
- Query results are consumed by chains that expect consistent column naming.
- Parameter binding must be compatible with SQLAlchemy engine conventions.

## 11. Code Examples

```python
from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase

db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("scratchbird://user:pass@localhost:3092/db")
```

## 12. Vendor-Specific Test Criteria

- Validate schema introspection and sample query execution.
- Confirm long-running queries can be cancelled by the chain.
